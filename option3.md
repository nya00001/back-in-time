# Exploring the town

I visit a lively marketplace and speak with a local baker, who shares tales of the town. As evening approaches, I find shelter at a modest inn, exchanging stories for a night's stay.
Lying in the rough bedding, I ponder my mysterious arrival to this era and how I might return. But for now, I'm a stranger in medieval England, navigating life in a profoundly different time.
